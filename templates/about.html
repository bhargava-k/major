    <p class="text-li mx-auto mt-6">
        Modern technologies have given human society the ability to produce enough food to meet the demand of people. 
        However, food security remains threatened by a number of factors including climate change, 
        the decline in pollinators , plant diseases , and others. Plant diseases are not only a threat to food security at the global scale, but can also have disastrous consequences for 
        smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on healthy crops. In the developing world, more than 80 percent of the agricultural production is generated by smallholder farmers ,
        and reports of yield loss of more than 50% due to pests and diseases are common . 
        Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is 
        easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.<br>
        <br>
        
        Various efforts have been developed to prevent crop loss due to diseases. Historical approaches of widespread application of pesticides have in the past decade 
        increasingly been supplemented by integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. Independent of the approach, identifying a disease correctly when it first 
        appears is a crucial step for efficient disease management. Historically, disease identification has been supported by agricultural extension organizations or other institutions, 
        such as local plant clinics. In more recent times, such efforts have additionally been supported by providing information for disease diagnosis online, leveraging the 
        increasing Internet penetration worldwide.
        <br>
        <br>
        Crop diseases rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the 
        world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. Recent advances in 
        computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for plant disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 
        diseased and healthy plant leaves collected, we trained a deep convolutional neural network to identify diseases.
        In this web application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf,
        and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.</p>
